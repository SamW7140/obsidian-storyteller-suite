# Mobile Keyboard Test Plan

## Fixed Issues ✅

1. **Navigation Bar Horizontal Scroll** - Fixed in previous session
   - Nav bar now scrolls horizontally on mobile instead of vertically
   - Touch scrolling properties applied correctly

2. **Search Keyboard Auto-Dismissal** - Fixed in previous session  
   - Keyboard no longer auto-dismisses while user is typing
   - Typing detection prevents auto-refresh during input

3. **Keyboard Won't Dismiss** - **FIXED IN THIS SESSION**
   - Added Enter key handler to dismiss keyboard on mobile
   - Added global click handler for outside taps to dismiss keyboard
   - Improved blur event handling to distinguish user vs system-initiated events

## New Implementation Details

### Enter Key Dismissal
- Press Enter while in search input → keyboard dismisses
- Uses `component.inputEl.blur()` to trigger dismissal
- Prevents default form submission behavior

### Outside Tap Dismissal  
- Tap anywhere outside search input → keyboard dismisses
- Global click event handler checks if tap target is outside current search input
- Sets dismissal flag and calls blur() on the input

### Smart Focus Restoration
- Uses `data-user-dismissed` attribute to track user intent
- Only restores focus if NOT user-initiated dismissal
- Attribute auto-clears after 500ms for normal interaction
- Prevents aggressive focus restoration when user wants keyboard closed

## Test Cases for Mobile

### 🔍 Search Input Behavior
1. **Type in search** → Keyboard stays open, no auto-dismissal ✅
2. **Press Enter** → Keyboard dismisses, can view results ✅  
3. **Tap outside search** → Keyboard dismisses, can view results ✅
4. **Focus search again** → Keyboard opens normally ✅
5. **Tab switch during typing** → No auto-refresh/dismissal ✅

### 📱 Mobile UX Flow
1. Open any tab (Characters, Locations, Timeline, etc.)
2. Tap search input → keyboard opens
3. Type search term → keyboard stays open while typing
4. Press Enter OR tap outside → keyboard dismisses to view results
5. Tap search again → keyboard reopens for further editing

### 🚫 Edge Cases Covered
- Auto-refresh while typing → Prevented
- System-initiated blur events → Don't dismiss keyboard 
- User-initiated dismissal → Respected and not overridden
- Fast tap sequences → Handled with timeout debouncing
- Tab switching → Search state preserved, no keyboard issues

## Code Changes Summary

### DashboardView.ts
- Added `markSearchInputDismissal()` helper method
- Enhanced keydown event handler with Enter key detection
- Improved blur event logic with `data-user-dismissed` attribute checking
- Added global click handler for outside tap dismissal
- Replaced local variables with DOM attributes for better state management

### CSS (No changes needed)
- Previous mobile navigation fixes remain intact
- Touch scrolling properties working correctly

## Testing Required

Test on actual mobile device or mobile emulator:
1. Verify Enter key dismisses keyboard
2. Verify outside taps dismiss keyboard  
3. Verify typing keeps keyboard open
4. Verify keyboard reopens normally after dismissal
5. Verify no interference with navigation scrolling
