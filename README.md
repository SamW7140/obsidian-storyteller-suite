## Groups Feature

The Storyteller Suite plugin now supports **Groups**â€”collections of characters, events, and locations that can be managed together. Groups are shared across all entity types and can be used to organize your story world by factions, teams, timelines, or any custom grouping.

- **See group membership** in the group modal and in each entity's modal.

2. Click **Create new group** to open the GroupModal. Enter a name, description, and color, then add members.
3. To edit a group, click the **Edit** button next to the group in the list.
4. To assign a character, event, or location to a group, open its modal and use the Groups dropdown.
5. Changes to groups are reflected in all relevant modals in real time.
