# Changelog

## 2.0.0-beta.1

### Added
- Native high-performance Canvas timeline with viewport culling, calendar-native axes, track and entity lanes, eras, Gantt dependencies, narrative connectors, drag editing, and branch comparison for forked timelines.
- Per-story dating systems with arbitrary month counts, leap rules, day or minute precision, cycle overlays, holidays, and bundled Gregorian, 13 Moons, and Japanese kō examples.
- Portable `.storycal.json` calendar and `.storytl.json` appearance documents with validation and Unicode-safe share codes for Vault Hub distribution.
- Timeline themes inherit from the active Obsidian theme by default and can selectively override semantic colors and layout roles.

### Changed
- Alternate timelines can be compared as visual branches that inherit main-history events through their divergence points.
- Removed the vis-timeline and timeline-arrows runtime dependencies.

### Beta notes
- Install through BRAT from the repository's `2.0.0-beta.1` prerelease. This beta does not alter or migrate existing event notes.

## 1.8.19

### Added
- Books compile as drafts directly from the Books tab, so a whole book can be assembled without building a manuscript selection by hand first.
- Custom compile steps can run their own JavaScript. This is off by default and gated behind a settings toggle, since a compile step runs arbitrary code against your vault.
- Interface layout override setting, for cases where the automatic phone, tablet, and desktop detection picks the wrong layout.
- Help tab now gathers the tutorial, contact, and support links in one place, with the video tutorial linked from there.

### Fixed
- Long modals could not be scrolled. Modal content that ran past the bottom of the window was simply unreachable, which made the compile workflow modal unusable at smaller window sizes. All modals now cap at 85% of the window height and scroll their content.
- Surface devices flipped into tablet mode when the keyboard was still attached.
- Settings pane came up blank after Obsidian moved the window between displays.
- Timeline regressions that were lost when the beta branch was cut are back on the release build: the timeline fills its container again, drag edits persist, and narrative connectors resolve and redraw correctly.
- Plot hole detector resolved character references by id and reported holes against characters it should have matched.

### Changed
- Entity references, location history, connections, and custom fields are written to frontmatter as readable strings instead of nested structures, so the notes stay legible when read outside the plugin.
- Compile tab uses Lucide icons in place of emoji glyphs.

### Internal
- Export HTML is rendered through Obsidian's MarkdownRenderer with vault images inlined as data URIs, so an exported file stands alone.

## 1.8.18

### Added
- Timeline dates accept unpadded fantasy and historical years. A year can be written the natural way (`342`) or zero-padded (`0342`) and both place identically in Timeline and Gantt mode; one-, two-, and three-digit years are read as years. Unpadded year-month and year-month-day (`342-3-1`) work too.
- Date ranges render Gantt bars. An event with a span such as `342 to 367` draws a bar instead of a single dot, and `through`, `until`, `..`, and an en-dash also work as separators. Full-date spans (`0342-03-01 to 0342-09-15`) and BCE spans (`500 BCE to 400 BCE`) are handled on both ends.

### Fixed
- A bare year like `342` was misread as a clock time (3:42) and landed the event at the present day instead of on the intended ancient timeline. Short years are now parsed as years ahead of the casual-date pass, so historical and fantasy events sit where they belong. Already-padded dates are unaffected.

### Internal
- Cleared Obsidian plugin-review lint findings in the template modals and converter (block-body `forEach` callbacks, `activeDocument`, sentence-case placeholders, a base-to-string guard, and a redundant type assertion). No user-facing behavior change.

## 1.8.17

### Fixed
- Blank Storyteller settings pane in Obsidian 1.13+ (separate settings window), now fixed reliably across devices. Obsidian can swap in the real settings container after the first render, and the delay varies by device, so the pane now keeps re-rendering until it actually shows content instead of relying on a fixed timer.

## 1.8.16

### Fixed
- Settings pane blank on first open in Obsidian 1.13+ (separate settings window): Obsidian can call the settings renderer before the container is attached to the new window, so the first render was discarded and the pane stayed blank until settings were reopened. The pane now re-renders automatically if it ends up empty, so it shows on the first open.

## 1.8.15

### Fixed
- Settings pane reliability in Obsidian 1.13+: the entire settings render is now guarded, so if any part fails the pane shows the error in place (with details) instead of going completely blank. This resolves the blank Storyteller settings pane reported on Obsidian 1.13's separate settings window.

## 1.8.14

### Fixed
- Settings pane no longer renders blank in Obsidian 1.13+, which opens Settings in a separate window where the plugin stylesheet is not guaranteed to apply. The settings layout's non-collapsing height and flex structure are now set inline, so the pane renders regardless of which window hosts it.

## 1.8.13

### Added
- Templates can link the entities they create to **existing** vault entities (locations, magic systems, groups, cultures, etc.) chosen when the template is applied. Define links in a new **Links** tab in the template editor; the apply dialog then prompts for the existing entities to attach. No duplicate entities are created.
- The gallery upload folder is now selected from a dropdown of vault folders instead of a free-text field.

### Fixed
- Plugin settings no longer render blank under newer Obsidian settings windows: the settings layout uses a non-collapsing height, missing settings collections are guarded before rendering, and a failing settings section shows a message instead of blanking the whole pane.

### Internal
- Rolls up ongoing template, timeline, and map editor improvements.

## 1.8.12

### Internal
- Isolated the Storyteller UI styles so they no longer leak into the rest of the Obsidian workspace.

## 1.8.11

### Fixed
- Daily writing goal notifications now fire only when the day's word count first crosses the configured goal, instead of repeating after every later writing-session save.

## 1.8.10

### Internal
- Cleared the remaining Obsidian plugin-review lint findings: the timeline dependency-arrow layer now uses `activeDocument` for popout-window compatibility, its static SVG styling moved out of inline assignments into stylesheet classes (with `--dashed`/`--dotted` modifiers for line types), `hasOwnProperty` is called via `Object.prototype`, and a ternary-as-statement became an explicit `if`/`else`. Removed redundant type assertions in the save-as-template, prompt, and dashboard code by narrowing through `const` captures. No user-facing behavior change.

## 1.8.9

### Fixed
- Story Board: the create/overwrite confirmation no longer resolves on a 100ms timeout race. It now awaits the modal result, and creating a new story board opens the generated canvas automatically.
- Groups dashboard: long group descriptions render as a clamped markdown preview instead of overflowing the card.
- Maps dashboard: added an **Open maps panel** action and per-map open buttons so maps are reachable directly from the dashboard.

## 1.8.8

### Security
- The bundled JSZip dependency no longer ships the `immediate`/`setimmediate` IE-era scheduler fallbacks that injected `<script>` elements at runtime. A build-time transform collapses those four branches to their existing `setTimeout` path, so `main.js` contains no dynamic script-element creation. EPUB/ODT import is unaffected — the `MutationObserver` scheduler JSZip actually uses in Obsidian is left intact.

## 1.8.7

### Fixed
- Map panels now apply the dynamic viewport height (`dvh`) via an `@supports` fallback instead of a duplicate `max-height` declaration, clearing Obsidian's duplicate-property CSS lint warnings.

### Security
- Character-sheet previews now strip inline event handlers (`on*`) and `javascript:` URLs in addition to `<script>`/`<iframe>`/`<object>`/`<embed>`, so user-authored sheet templates cannot execute code.

### Internal
- Release workflow verifies that `manifest.json`/`package.json`/`versions.json` agree with the release tag before building, preventing mismatched release artifacts (the cause of the mis-tagged 1.8.6).

## 1.8.6

### Fixed
- Removed obsolete generated CSS output and consolidated duplicate stylesheet rules so Obsidian's CSS lint warnings no longer report stale `main.css` issues or duplicate selectors from Storyteller Suite styles.

## 1.8.5

### Fixed
- SceneModal Date field and Campaign board map dropdown no longer overflow past the left edge of their setting row. The plugin-scope `.setting-item-control` rule now constrains its input/select/dropdown children with `max-width: 100%; min-width: 0; box-sizing: border-box` instead of clipping the container with `overflow: hidden`, so wide inputs shrink to fit rather than spilling out and overlapping the label.

### Internal
- Release workflow no longer builds or uploads the `storyteller-suite-X.Y.Z.zip` artifact. Releases now ship only `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` — the three files Obsidian actually loads.

## 1.8.1

### Changed
- Reduced `!important` usage in styles by 107 declarations (288 → 181) — remaining instances are vendor overrides for Leaflet, vis-timeline, and Obsidian core that genuinely require it.
- Expanded all 3-digit hex colors in styles to the 6-digit format for consistency.
- Replaced `:has()` selectors in the gallery markdown rendering with a tagging post-processor that adds explicit classes, avoiding the selector-invalidation performance pitfall.
- Replaced the `:has()` selectors used for mobile modal button-container sizing with explicit classes.

### Internal
- Dropped `js-yaml`, `dotenv`, `@types/js-yaml`, and `builtin-modules` from devDependencies; the build's Node-builtins list is now hardcoded instead of imported.
- Release workflow now produces GitHub artifact attestations (`actions/attest-build-provenance@v2`) for `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`, and the release zip.

## 1.8.0

### Fixed
- Network graph: stopped crashing with "toLowerCase is not a function" when an entity field held a typed-relationship object, wikilink-wrapped value, or non-string instead of a plain name. The resolver now coerces those shapes and falls back to skipping the bad value instead of killing the whole graph.
- Network graph: surfaced initialization errors in the console instead of swallowing them silently, so future failures can be diagnosed.
- Timeline: removed the invalid `verticalScrollSticky` vis-timeline option that produced an "Unknown option" warning on every render.

### Changed
- Storyteller guide modal now includes a Ko-fi support button alongside the dashboard / what's new / close actions.
- Updated "What's new" guide copy for the 1.8.0 dashboard mobile improvements.

### Internal
- Fixed all ESLint violations flagged by the Obsidian community plugin scorecard.

## 1.7.9-beta.1

- Migrate Culture and Economy modals onto the shared `createStructuredModalLayout` + `createFooterButton` footer used by every other entity modal, so their Save / Cancel / Delete buttons match the rest of the suite on mobile (sticky footer, correct touch targets) instead of rendering as a stacked legacy `Setting` row.

## 1.7.9-beta.0

- Auto-update gallery records and entity image references when an image file or its parent folder is renamed or moved, so `profileImagePath`, `coverImagePath`, `backgroundImagePath`, `image`, and `images[]` no longer go stale.
- Read scene Beats, culture/economy/compendium body sections, book Synopsis, and item Cultural Significance / Magic Properties back into their fields when loading notes, so data entered in the markdown body or saved through the modal is no longer dropped on reload.
- Fix scene save/load mismatch where the modal wrote `## Beats` but the loader only read `## Beat Sheet`, then keep `## Beat Sheet` working as a legacy fallback.
- Unify the Cancel / Save / Delete footer on MagicSystem, CompendiumEntry, and TemplateEditor modals so they match the structured-modal layout used across the rest of the suite.
- Restore characters dropped from the writing heatmap when scene `linkedCharacters` capitalisation drifted from the canonical name.
- Include undated events in the analytics events stat, and divide the event-distribution chart by the dated event count so the percentages add up correctly.
- Stop matching unrelated entities by partial-substring during EntitySyncService lookups; fall back only to case-insensitive name matches.
- Run wiki-link bracket canonicalisation through the bidirectional-link backfill so re-imports leave files in the same shape a normal save would.
- Consolidate three duplicate `stripWikiLinkValue` implementations into a shared utility that handles aliases (`[[Real|Display]]`) and anchors (`[[Name#Section]]`).
- Replace the silently lossy fallback frontmatter parser with a strict `parseYaml`-only reader that errors on malformed YAML instead of dropping nested fields.
- Re-run the bidirectional-link backfill on every plugin upgrade instead of only on first install.

## 1.7.8-beta.19

- Fix iPad dashboard layout detection by falling back to real touch-device viewport signals when Obsidian's mobile app flags are missing, so tablets stop falling through the desktop tab layout path.

## 1.7.8-beta.18

- Remove the leftover dashboard tab CSS that was still arguing with the new layout shell, so tablets stop falling back to the old wrapped tab behavior.
- Keep the dashboard tab rail horizontal across phone, tablet portrait, and tablet landscape, and add a runtime regression so that split mobile behavior does not sneak back in.

## 1.7.8-beta.17

- Keep dashboard tabs on one horizontal scroll rail across all mobile layouts, including tablets, and remove the old phone-only overflow tab path that was still splitting mobile behavior.

## 1.7.8-beta.16

- Replace native confirm dialogs on dashboard delete actions with an in-app confirmation modal so deleting an entry no longer leaves keyboard focus stuck and blocks typing in editors and inputs until the Obsidian window is reactivated.
- Render footer buttons in modals through Obsidian's ButtonComponent so the "Delete" label shows on Maps, Gallery, Groups, References, Writing, and Books edit modals the same way it does on Cultures and Economies.

## 1.7.8-beta.15

- Lift the modal scroll height cap on mobile fullscreen so create and edit modals use the full viewport in landscape instead of squeezing the form into a sliver.
- Stop auto-mirroring family, ally, rival, and romantic relationships in the network graph so picking "father" between two characters renders one labeled arrow instead of two stacked ones.

## 1.7.8-beta.14

- Auto-grow textareas inside modals so the native textarea scrollbar no longer stacks alongside the modal scrollbar when the field has a lot of content.

## 1.7.8-beta.13

- Fix character creation modal not scrolling on desktop so the Save and Cancel buttons no longer get cut off when the form is taller than the window.
- Apply the same scroll fix to every modal that uses the structured layout helper.
- Refresh the dashboard tabs automatically after chapter and scene edits or deletes so the list reflects changes without needing to switch tabs.
- Preserve empty content and summary sections when saving chapters and scenes instead of falling back to the template default.
- Parse magic system rule, source, cost, limitation, and training sections back into their fields when loading older notes.

## 1.7.8-beta.11

- Move the main remaining legacy create/edit modals onto ResponsiveModal so they use the same mobile modal flow as the fixed character modal instead of plain Obsidian modal behavior.

## 1.7.8-beta.10

- Upgrade legacy Storyteller modal action rows at runtime so older create/edit modals get split scroll + footer layout on mobile instead of staying inside the scroller.

## 1.7.8-beta.9

- Normalize the old modal action-row pattern so other create/edit modals inherit the same footer button styling and mobile behavior as the character modal fixes.

## 1.7.8-beta.8

- Replace character modal footer actions with explicit buttons so create/save uses one consistent style and click path on mobile.

## 1.7.8-beta.7

- Publish the rebuilt beta artifact so BRAT and branch installs get the actual latest character modal fixes instead of stale code.

## 1.7.8-beta.6

- Remove the character sheet action from the create character flow so the footer stays focused on the current product state.
- Make character modal footer buttons follow the active accent styling on beta builds.

## 1.7.8-beta.5

- Fix character create modal on mobile so the form body scrolls separately and the footer actions stay visible, including the save button.
